This project contains working source code for the examples given in the ClearCanvas Developer's Guide.
Please refer to that document for thorough descriptions working through each example.
Examples can be correlated to specific files by examining the namespace of the class.
For example, the TextEditorComponent class is in the MyPlugin.TextEditor namespace.
This corresponds to the TextEditorComponent.cs file in the TextEditor directory.
