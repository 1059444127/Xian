							<p>Welcome to the ClearCanvas Workstation

							host of resources.  Here, you can learn
							how to build the software from scratch
							using a tool like Visual C# Express, how
							the software works and how the pieces fit
							together, and even how to write plugins
							and contribute to this <a

								project</a>.

										<a
											href="cmd:LaunchCCWorkstationInstall">Install
											CC Workstation Beta</a> This launches a
										self-contained installation program that will
										install the Workstation beta software onto your
										computer. <em>This software is for evaluation
										purposes only and should not be used in a
										clinical setting.</em> This version of the
										software requires Windows 2000 or later with
										Microsoft .NET 2.0 in order to run.
										</p>

										<p>
										<a href="cmd:OpenSampleImages">Sample
											Images</a> This is a collection of sample
										DICOM images that you may use with CC
										Workstation to test out the currently
										available features. To make use of these
										sample images, you need to run this
										self-extracting archive and store the images
										to a folder on your local harddisk. Then you
										may either use the &quot;My Computer&quot;
										Study Explorer widget to load the images for
										viewing, or use the Rebuild Utility to put
										references to the images into a SQL
										Server database. If the images are referenced
										in the database, you may them load them from the 
										&quot;My Local DataStore&quot; widget in the
										future.
										</p>

										<p>
										<a
											href="cmd:LaunchSQLServerExpressInstall">Install
											SQL Server 2005 Express Edition</a>
										CC Workstation is currently able to load images for
										viewing in two different ways. First, you can
										browse your local filesystem using a file
										browser and pick the images you want to load.
										This is done through the &quot;My
										Computer&quot; widget. In addition, however,
										you may opt to use SQL Server to persist
										references to the images stored on disk. This
										means you won't have to use a browser every
										time you want to take a look at some images.
										Image loading performance is also a bit
										better with a database. This second way of
										loading images is done through the &quot;My
										Local DataStore&quot; widget. You must
										install SQL Server 2005 Express Edition
										manually and select the SQL Server
										Authenticatoin type. You must then run a set
										of SQL scripts that will create the database
										schema for you.
										</p>

										<p>
										<a href="cmd:OpenDocumentation">SDK
											Documentation</a> This is comprised of
										two documents: a <a
											href="cmd:OpenDevelopersGuide">
											developer's guide</a>, which you can
										view if you have a PDF reader, and the <a
											href="SDK/Documentation/framework_reference.chm">Framework
											Reference</a>.
										</p>

										<p>
										<a href="cmd:OpenSourceCode">Source Code</a>
										The source tree is archived into a ZIP file.
										To start working with the source, simply
										extract the files into their own folder on
										your local harddisk drive. To build the
										source code, you will need a C# compiler like
										Visual Studio 2005, or Visual C# Express
										Edition, which you may find on this CD-ROM.
										</p>

										<p>
										<a
											href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualcsharp/">Download
											Visual C# Express Edition</a> What a boon
										from Microsoft! It's now easier than ever to
										create your own software or learn to write
										software programs when Microsoft provides
										this edition of their C# compiler and
										development environment for free.
										</p>

										<p>
										<a href="cmd:OpenTemplates">Visual Studio
											Templates</a> You can install and use
										these templates to get a head start in
										writing plugins for ClearCanvas Workstation.
										We hope you will enjoy this convenience and
										have fun with it!
